/* Hashing Data Structure*/

/*
 * Applications of hashing
 *  -> Dictionaries
 *  -> Cryptography
 *  -> cashes
 *  -> Symbol Table in compilers / interpreters
 *  -> Routeres
 *  DIrect acceess table
 *
 * Q. How HASH FUNCTION work?
 *  - Should always map a large key to same small key
 *  - Should generate  values from 0 to m-1.
 *  - should be fast, O(1) for integers, and  O(len) for string oflength "len"
 *  - should uniformly distribute large key into Hash Table slots.
 *  # Example of Hash Function
 *  - H ( large_key ) = large_key%m
 *
 *  - For sstrings , weighted sum
 *          str [] = " abcd "
 *     str[0]* x^0 + str[1]* x^1 + str[2]* x^2 + sstr[3]* x^3
 *  - universally  Distributed the  keys  in Table.
 *  - ideally , choose prime number
 *  - Chancce of collision is less
 *
 *          Bad value of m -> power of 2,10
